## RFCs Open for Comment
Two RFC’s are now available for comment by the community:
•	[Variant Information and Knowledge Exchange Principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bM2L3Ux3CrGISUVETVeVcvK8e0XT_Zey/edit) -- COMMENTS CLOSE 12/21/2021
•	[Considerations about future gene pages and gene-centric dashboard for CFDE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n9sKKGcXpZscG-eGClg7RmUs8fzYbeQ1/edit) -- Comments Close January 11th.

RFC stands for “Requests for Comments”. These are proposals being made by members of the CFDE to suggest that the CFDE community as a whole adopt the suggested new best practice. Everyone in the community is invited to respond to these proposals by leaving comments, critiques, and support at the links above. Comments are open for one month at which point the documents will be reviewed. If there are no substantial objections to the RFC in that time, it will be adopted as a CFDE Best Practice. You can read more about our RFC process here.

The [Use of Uberon for anatomy in the C2M2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-KYUOvzO6NMiHqnl9G8JzakLcqJbkfG/edit)  RFC is also still available for comment by the community until December 15th.
