# CFDE Announcements

## June All-Hands Meeting
The CFDE Program Team is pleased to announce we will be holding the annual CFDE Program Meeting on June 9-10, 2022 at the Bethesdan Hotel in Bethesda, MD. The purpose of this meeting is to bring together the CFDE community to review progress over the past year and discuss strategic issues that impact the ecosystem as a whole. At this time, we are striving for an all in-person meeting.

Please relay any concerns to the CFDE helpdesk at [support@cfde.atlassian.net](mailto:support@cfde.atlassian.net).

## CFDE Portal Data and Feature Update

We are excited to announce a new release of the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/)! This release features both a data and feature update!

We are very excited to announce the addition of a new Common Fund group: Glycosciences! The goal of Glycosciences is to create new resources, tools, and methods to make the study of sugars more accessible to the broader research community.

### Common Fund Programs on the CFDE Portal:

- 4D Nucleome Data Coordination and Integration Center
- Extracellular RNA Communication
- The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program
- Genotype-Tissue Expression
- Glycosciences
- The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program
- The Human Microbiome Project
- Illuminating the Druggable Genome
- Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures
- Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions
- University of California San Diego Metabolomics Workbench

### New CFDE Portal Features:

- **Personal collections** can be created and exported. Users can create collections of data they are interested in and search within a collection.
- New icons on the homepage allow users to start a search by **disease**, **gene**, or **compound**.
- Users can now search for new types of data: **time series**, **proteins**, **compounds**, and **substances**. These can be searched for at the individual level or within a project or collection group. For example, users can search for the compound T-disaccharide in kidneys in a collection. An example of this search is [here](https://app.nih-cfde.org/chaise/recordset/#1/CFDE:collection/*::facets::N4IghgdgJiBcDaoDOB7ArgJwMYFM6JFU1wGscBPOEAZQH0sUMdaAzMLAFxAF8AaUAJYQARumj4QAYQBiAEQCiIXiAZNW7DrUhgOKALbl6jZm06sylALp9Q6DqLTiEUuYuWqTGrRB37D23QNzChBrZQgBGEt3AAsUAVwkfAAmAAYAdjDkdGw8BGziHAsqOgAHNGEsGJw9dU4efhAhByd4FwUlEHLK6trTTQY9UrEoWm6qmrrNFmKskDsWmGcZDuVx3qmjIZGt4cdRmZCwkAio2PjE-AAWAGYARjuANmtrIA@sort(combined_fact,nid)).

### CFDE Portal Summary Facts:

- The CFDE Search Portal now contains data from eleven different Common Fund Programs
- Data types on the Portal include assays, DNA and RNA sequences, images, text reports, and more
- Available data can be visualized on the “Preview the data” section of the homepage
