# CFDE Announcements


## Updates

### DCC Funding Announcement
On January 29th, the funding announcement that will allow the Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) was published. You can find the announcement, and important dates, [on our website](https://nih-cfde.org/engaging-common-fund-data-coordinating-centers/) 

### CFDE Kickoff/DCC Pre-Proposer Meeting
The funding announcement came just in time to be announced at our CFDE Kickoff/DCC Pre-Proposer Meeting. The meeting brought together representitives from most of the Common Fund DCCs to discuss how they would like to collaborate with the CFDE-CC and each other. You can see meeting notes, presentations and other information [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1fPTjR_9vU7rDvwygKZD14xbek6YDEZsY). That folder is *not* in the protected Google drive, as most of the DCC staff are not yet onboarded.

### DCCs have begun onboarding

You'll start to see a lot of new faces over the coming weeks. As of the Pre-Proposer Meeting, we are officially onboarding DCC staff into our work spaces. Be sure to say hello!

### Other Funding Opportunities
This week, the NIH announced the [DATA Scholar Program](https://datascience.nih.gov/data-scholars), which offers 1-2 years of funding for individuals who are experienced in data and computer science to work on a number of different trans-NIH initiatives. [One of the awards is specifically geared towards working with the CFDE](https://datascience.nih.gov/data-scholars-projects/innovative-solutions-for-data-harmonization-mobile-analytics-and-end-user-support). These positions are directly hired to the NIH, and are open to anyone with relevant experience. Please encourage your contacts to apply.
