# CFDE Announcements

Hello Everyone! We hope you all are doing well. We have some exciting news and developments to share this week. Please let us know if you have something you'd like to share by adding comments to [the open announcements issue](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Announcements). 

## New Release

The [CFDE Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/) was demonstrated to the NIH and is now viewable. This is not a public release, so **_please don't share_** the site outside of the consortium. Advertising to the public will happen once the participating Common Fund Programs have had a chance review their data. We welcome you to explore the site and [provide feedback](https://github.com/nih-cfde/cfde-deriva/issues/53) to our development team as we work to improve the interface and functionality of the site before it's public debut.

With the demonstration of the portal the _NIH has approved CFDE-Coordination Center funding for the remainder of this year_. 


## Updates
 
The **CFDE Engagement Team** had their first site visit with members of the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (**A2CPS**) Program. Watch for a full report of their findings in the coming weeks.

Avi Maâ€™ayan and Daniel Clarke gave a presentation on their work with [FAIRshake](https://fairshake.cloud/) to the [PresQT group](https://presqt.crc.nd.edu/) at Notre Dame.

In collaboration with **Interface Guru**, we have completed our first round of user interface testing for the **CFDE Data Portal** (release notes above). This round of interviews focused on NIH Program Officers. Future interviews with both Researchers and Common Fund Program staff will start later this summer.
