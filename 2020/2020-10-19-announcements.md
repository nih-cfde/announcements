## CFDE Training Site Release

The CFDE-CC Training Center has released [an updated training website]( https://cfde-training-and-engagement.readthedocs-hosted.com). The site hosts a series of training modules for training clinicians, researchers, and bioinformaticians in accessing and processing Common Fund data types. Modules include lessons on AWS (Amazon Web Services), Blast analysis in the cloud, Conda installation and use, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Kids First data access and analysis, an introductory Snakemake course, and more! 

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unplanned need for trainings to work independently or virtually, rather than in person and our goal is to create materials versatile and flexible enough to be used effectively in different situations and environments with the ability to enhance trainings with virtual or in-person sessions to allow more a more interactive experience and direct support. The site hosts content in a variety of formats such as vidlets, online training modules, and reference resources to help learners independently gain the skills they need to work with their data. 

## Welcome
