# CFDE Announcements

Greetings CFDE Members! We hope you are all having a safe and happy holiday season. 

## Cross-Pollination Events

Cross-Pollination Events are continuing on a monthly basis. Events are taking place on the first Tuesday of every month with various CFDE Members hosting workshops and webinars.  On Tuesday, December 1 our first in this new series took place with Bernard de Bono presenting **Establishing the CFDE Anatomy Working Group** on behalf of **SPARC**.   SPARC representatives plan in coming weeks to reach out to all DCC PIs to form a working group to collect and prioritize Common Fund project requirements for anatomy-based search, browsing, annotation, and anatomy knowledge presentation that can be ingested as metadata into the C2M2 model.

Our next Cross-Pollination Event will take place on January 5, 2021. The agenda is still being determined, and anyone interested in presenting can contact us at [support@cfde.atlassian.net](support@cfde.atlassian.net) with a topic, proposed length, and date.

## Training Pilot

On December 1, Titus Brown and Abhijna Parigi hosted an "Introduction to Amazon Web Services / Elastic Cloud Computing" workshop via Zoom. Using materials created for the [CFDE Training Website](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/), the instructors helped our pilot group negotiate logging on to AWS, creating an instance, and running an example BLAST analysis. Through training assessment and feedback we hope to improve our materials and trainings for future CFDE Training events.
