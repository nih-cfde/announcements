Happy Holidays, fellow CFDE members!

## Cross-Pollination Events

Following our December 1 meeting on **Establishing the CFDE Anatomy Working Group**  Bernard de Bono and team **SPARC** are busy organizing cAWG to begin the hard work of building consensus for data ingest, anatomy-based search, browsing, annotation, and more for the CrossCut Data Model (C2M2).   

Our next meeting will take place on January 5, 2021. Our current agenda includes a presentation from Kids First and an Ontology Working Group session presented by the CFDE-CC. Our upcoming meetings are listed on the [CFDE Cross-Pollination Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQAeOLkivUZZnwZ_KxfGw3neezMaWbrPk9nnFiKfQGA/edit?usp=sharing). Contact us at support@cfde.atlassian.net if you would like to present.
