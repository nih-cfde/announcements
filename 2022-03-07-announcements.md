# CFDE Announcements

## Cross-Pollination Events
Our next scheduled meeting will take place on **Tuesday, April 5th at 11am PT / 2pm ET**.  This meeting will include [R03 presentations and a presentation on converting data into the C2M2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nYiJkrvwpOefg78qtYrwCROaD7Bur6FlkwJ-aZuuTYI/edit#heading=h.af0seinevhzq). Regular Cross-Pollination events take place on the first Tuesday of every month. Please check out the  [Cross-Pollination Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQAeOLkivUZZnwZ_KxfGw3neezMaWbrPk9nnFiKfQGA/edit?usp=sharing) for more details. We are currently looking for speakers for our February meeting. Please let us know at support@cfde.atlassian.net if you have something to share!

## CFDE February Hackathon
The week of February 21-25, 2022, we hosted [the first Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Hackathon](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-feb-hackathon). The goals of the hackathon were to increase familiarity with data sets from [Common Fund programs](https://commonfund.nih.gov/programs) and work towards cross-cutting, integrative analyses. You can read a summary and view presentations given here: http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2022-feb-hackathon.html

We are also excited to announce that the second CFDE Hackathon will take place April 25 - 29th! We're going to fine tune the event with the feedback from our February event, and we hope you will join us!

If you are interested in learning more about attending the April 2022 Hackathon as a participant, please [register here](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/april-2022-hackathon/?pk_campaign=anc)! We hope to see you there :)

## CFDE Training Efforts
On **March 7th and 9th** we are running our two-part [RNA-Seq in the Cloud](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/rna-seq-in-the-cloud-part-i-2/?pk_campaign=anc) workshop. Check out our [Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/) for details and registration availability. If you have questions or suggestions for our training team, get in touch with us at [training@cfde.atlassian.net](mailto:training@cfde.atlassian.net)

## NIH Common Fund - Funding Opportunities
The new NIH Common Fund Program - Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) will start in 2023 (https://commonfund.nih.gov/smaht).

The goal of this new program is to propel discovery of new biological processes in human health and disease that are mediated by genomic variation in somatic tissues. There are three main areas of interest in the first five years of the program: 1) Building a scaffold and foundational datasets that catalog somatic variation across a set of common tissues from a diverse donor pool, 2) developing tools focused on increasing the sensitivity of detection and specificity of the pipelines to detect multiple types of variations, and 3) creating a variant catalog, portal, and integrated workbench that facilitates access to the tools, technologies, and data developed by the Network.

Five initiatives have recently been issued to achieve these goals:

RFA-RM-22-011 -Technology and Tools Development Projects will develop next generation tools focused on significantly improving detection and characterization of somatic variants: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-22-011.html
RFA-RM-22-012 - Tissue Procurement Center will collect, process, and distribute a set of 10-15 high quality human tissues from a diverse donor cohort: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-22-012.html
RFA-RM-22-013 - Genome Characterization Centers will use state-of-the-art genomics sequencing technologies to identify all types of somatic variation in tissues from the Tissue Procurement Center:  https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-22-013.html
RFA-RM-22-009 - Organizational Center will coordinate Network activities and establish strong links with related NIH and international programs: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-22-009.html
RFA-RM-22-010 - Data Analysis Center will integrate the data generated by the Network to build the variant catalog, portal, and workbench: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-22-010.html

While Letters of Intent are not required, they are strongly encouraged.  They are due June 8, 2022.
Applications are due July 8, 2022.

A Technical Assistance Webinar will be held at 12:00pm EDT on Friday, April 29, 2022. 
Please check the SMaHT website (https://commonfund.nih.gov/smaht) for details.
