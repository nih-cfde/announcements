## RFCs Available for Review and Comment
CFDE Members are invited to review and comment on the following RFCs:
- [Use of EDAM for “file_format and “data_type” fields in the file table of the C2M2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQPtk6381Yncxp8Apzxyv8YwPNYIcvWEAH0gKraqKHE/edit)
- [Use of DOID for “disease” field in the C2M2 model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OS_69jvdexMvH9KSptGDAKAXCzyDtca2M0VjsGXImEE/edit)

RFC stands for “Requests for Comments”. These are proposals being made by members of the CFDE to suggest that the CFDE community as a whole adopt the suggested new best practice. Everyone in the community is invited to respond to these proposals by leaving comments, critiques, and support at the links above. Comments are open for one month at which point the documents will be reviewed. If there are no substantial objections to the RFC in that time, it will be adopted as a CFDE Best Practice. You can read more about our RFC process here.
If you have any questions, please email the helpdesk at support@cfde.atlassian.net

## CFDE Trainings and Workshops
The CFDE Training Team in collaboration with the [UC Davis DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/eventscalendar/introduction-to-remote-computing-11-part-series-workshop-1-intro-to-shell/) is hosting an 11-part **Introduction to Remote Computing** workshop series in August. The course will introduce attendees to the principles and practice of remote computing with UNIX on workstations, HPCs, and cloud. Topics include shell, editing remote files, ssh, remote file transfer, software installation with conda, project organization, automating analyses, cluster compute with slurm, and cloud compute with AWS. This pilot workshop series is already completely booked, but you can still explore the [CFDE Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/?pk_campaign=anc) to find and register for other future events. Our workshops are open to all, so feel free to share this information with interested friends and colleagues. Questions? Contact us at training@cfde.atlassian.net
