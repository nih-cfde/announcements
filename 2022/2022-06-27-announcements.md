## Content Generation Sprints
The CFDE-CC will be hosting two [Content Generation Sprints](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-content-generation-sprints/). The purpose of these sprints is to produce annotations for genes, anatomy terms, compounds, and diseases in the CFDE Search Portal. The **first sprint is underway** ending this Friday (July 1) . The second will take place **August 8 - 12**. Please indicate your interest and availability [here](https://forms.gle/zppvKfF5NQPXj4sr9).
