## Cancer Research Data Commons Workshop
The Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA) was developed to allow researchers to aggregate diverse data types hosted by Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) using a single interface, as opposed to having to access them individually. Using the CDA, users can query, discover, retrieve, and aggregate data according to a variety of search parameters, such as participant, sample, tissue, disease, or study. Participating data repositories in the current release are the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), Imaging Data Commons (IDC), and Proteomic Data Commons (PDC).

The CRDC is hosting a  hands-on workshop on **October 18th 1 PM-3 PM ET** to demonstrate it's functionality. Office hours will be held from 3 - 5pm ET that same day to ask questions or work with an expert. If this interests you, please review the[ agenda](https://urldefense.us/v3/__https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idpJU1tktH5ug9WaOCFFIHJaB2vrJDQ_1fH07hmHJ6s/edit__;!!JRQnnSFuzw7wjAKq6ti6!hZOiuj5LzHhcI4g9Nj4bZwKO6d_FjaOBMaJDPacGFSl8Jewo1wi4JUPLBujjdS00HmE6$), register [here](https://urldefense.us/v3/__https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxzEadsqKEKLKO1qY6j6jtqvzxcz43GUfbfwPoPEjx4C7xGw/viewform__;!!JRQnnSFuzw7wjAKq6ti6!hZOiuj5LzHhcI4g9Nj4bZwKO6d_FjaOBMaJDPacGFSl8Jewo1wi4JUPLBujjddUeDnMg$), and spread the word to colleagues who you think may also benefit from this info session.
