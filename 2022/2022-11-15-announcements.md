## CFDE Factoid

_This new section will include information or links that may not be well-known to the entire CFDE community. Here is the first factoid._ 

Did you know that the CFDE catalyzes discovery by breaking down data silos? This summer, CFDE members [created 20 videos](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-CoC-Videos/) showcasing a variety of tools and programs aimed at breaking down data silos. The videos are an excellent resource to share with colleagues inside and outside the CFDE.
