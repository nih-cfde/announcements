#### Content Registry Update

We are also pleased to announce the first public release of the content registry. The registry hosts annotations on gene, anatomy, compound, and disease portal pages.

An example annotation is here: https://app.nih-cfde.org/chaise/record/#1/CFDE:gene/nid=1

## Content Generation Sprints
The second session of the CFDE-CC hosted Content Generation Sprints last will take place **August 8 - 12**.
