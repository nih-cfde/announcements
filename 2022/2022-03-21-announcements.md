Attendees will be introduced to R syntax, variables, functions, packages, and data structures and learn how to import, tidy, transform, and visualize RNA-Seq data from the Gene Expression Tissue Project (GTEx). Check out our [Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/) for details and registration availability.

## CFDE February Hackathon
The week of February 21-25, 2022, we hosted [the first Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Hackathon](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-feb-hackathon). The goals of the hackathon were to increase familiarity with data sets from [Common Fund programs](https://commonfund.nih.gov/programs) and work towards cross-cutting, integrative analyses. You can read a summary and view presentations given here: http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2022-feb-hackathon.html

We are also excited to announce that the second CFDE Hackathon will take place April 25 - 29th! We're going to fine tune the event with the feedback from our February event, and we're looking for partners to run webinar, workshop, or hackathon sessions. If you are interested in running a session, please fill out this form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekOSh18ErAL_XdeaDliFTSQmkuoX0brlnq0SdYeutMNwdmcQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekOSh18ErAL_XdeaDliFTSQmkuoX0brlnq0SdYeutMNwdmcQ/viewform) 
We hope to see you there!
