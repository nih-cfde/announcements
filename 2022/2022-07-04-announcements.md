## Content Generation Sprints
The CFDE-CC hosted the first [Content Generation Sprint](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-content-generation-sprints/) last week. The purpose of these sprints is to produce annotations for genes, anatomy terms, compounds, and diseases in the CFDE Search Portal. The product of this sprint can be viewed at [https://github.com/nih-cfde/update-content-registry](https://github.com/nih-cfde/update-content-registry). The second will take place **August 8 - 12**.
