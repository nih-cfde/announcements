## CFDE Videos for Council of Councils

Thanks to everyone who submitted (draft) video demonstrations of CFDE technical products in advance of the Council of Councils meeting! Most of the videos can be viewed on a single webpage at https://nih-cfde.github.io/2022-CoC-Videos/. Please watch the videos and provide your feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Azttan73vUiia8rv8M0tkyE_SAGD4kdfoqhQN5HOB9Y/edit#).

## Content Generation Sprints

The second Content Generation Sprints is happening this week, **August 8 - 12**. The purpose of these sprints is to produce annotations for genes, anatomy terms, compounds, and diseases in the CFDE Search Portal. The product of our first sprint can be viewed at [https://github.com/nih-cfde/update-content-registry](https://github.com/nih-cfde/update-content-registry). Please join the #content-generation-sprint slack channel to participate. 

## GTEx/HuBMAP Explorer User Interface

**Feedback Sought on the Explorer User Interface for Accessing Integrated GTEx/HuBMAP Data .** The GTEx and HuBMAP teams have mapped 16 GTEx tissue locations to the HuBMAP Common Coordinate Framework (CCF). These 16 three-dimensional tissue block locations can be explored via the HuBMAP Exploration User Interface that has been integrated into the GTEx Portal. The GTEx and HuBMAP teams have created this brief survey to get your feedback on this data integration, and what more you would like to see. Please take 5 min to provide your input [via this short survey](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLScHpo2PLacAC2CmGdQ9XUEDNnfd6o9WyqUEv9SjMr80TyyqiQ%2Fviewform&data=05%7C01%7Cchristy.kano%40nih.gov%7C59dd80cb3521498d173b08da6a8437c2%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C637939413350851735%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=p9CGx7yq1qwj2jA34NHBf%2B5pYjvtX%2F0G%2F79WZWmSfjQ%3D&reserved=0).

## NIH Request For Information
The [NIH Common Fund](https://commonfund.nih.gov/) is soliciting ideas for potential new scientific programs that may be supported in fiscal year 2025 or beyond. Anyone can submit an idea in response to this  [Request for Information](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.usa.gov%2FxSkzc&data=05%7C01%7Cwendy.knosp%40nih.gov%7C7355c3b172e74aea00ea08da6bfed99a%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C637941040969607767%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=EPRQ3DJYeRiIdq%2FkP75mGVj0EgPZZDqBJ7NWrbO%2BWdE%3D&reserved=0)  that was recently published. The Common Fund supports [bold scientific programs](https://commonfund.nih.gov/programs) that catalyze discovery across all biomedical and behavioral research. These programs create a space where investigators and multiple NIH Institutes and Centers collaborate on innovative research expected to address high priority challenges for the NIH as a whole and make a broader impact in the scientific community. 

Common Fund programs:
-	Are trans-NIH (not disease-specific or relevant to the mission of only one or a few NIH Institutes or Centers)
-	Require a large, coordinated effort in which many investigators undertake research projects directed at a common goal
-	Have specific goals and deliverables that can be achieved in 5-10 years
-	Are sufficiently large and complex (with an approximate budget of $25-50 million/year for 5-10 years) to warrant a trans-NIH, coordinated approach

NIH encourages idea submissions that describe what you think is the greatest opportunity or challenge in biomedical research today and what makes it the right time to address this idea through a Common Fund program.
