## RFC - Open for Comments
Reminder: The [FAIR Principles for Sharing Information and Knowledge about Variants Regulating Gene Expression](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p5wsaf2pLr6WZWQX8v2sqHCnu14S8riU/edit) RFC is open for comments until April 29th. This proposal is being made by members of the CFDE to suggest that the CFDE community as a whole adopt the suggested new best practice. Everyone in the community is invited to respond by leaving comments, critiques, and support at the links above. Comments are open for one month at which point the documents will be reviewed. If there are no substantial objections to the RFC in that time, it will be adopted as a CFDE Best Practice. You can read more about our RFC process [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1masYhU6W_zgUWN1XWS8_f-KiSp1cTDdo4eZJWpsXyHQ/edit#heading=h.khb0tixgmaow).

## CFDE Training Efforts
On **Wednesday, April 27**, we will offer a two-hour [**Introduction to R for RNA-Seq Analysis**](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/introduction-to-r-for-rna-seq-analysis/?pk_campaign=anc) workshop using public data from GTEx. Check out our [Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/) for details and registration availability.
