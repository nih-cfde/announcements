## CFDE Helpdesk
The CFDE Helpdesk is available to answer and coordinate inquiries about any CFDE business. Any problems with portal submission, Zoom meetings, working groups, RFCs, or any other questions you might have can be directed to support@cfde.atlassian.net. 

## RFC - FAIR Principles for Sharing Information and Knowledge about Variants Regulating Gene Expression
The [FAIR Principles for Sharing Information and Knowledge about Variants Regulating Gene Expression](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p5wsaf2pLr6WZWQX8v2sqHCnu14S8riU/edit) RFC is available for comments until April 29th.

RFC stands for “Requests for Comments”. These are proposals being made by members of the CFDE to suggest that the CFDE community as a whole adopt the suggested new best practice. Everyone in the community is invited to respond to these proposals by leaving comments, critiques, and support at the links above. Comments are open for one month at which point the documents will be reviewed. If there are no substantial objections to the RFC in that time, it will be adopted as a CFDE Best Practice. You can read more about our RFC process here.
