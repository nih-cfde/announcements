# CFDE Announcements

## CFDE All-Hands Meeting -- April 2023
The April CFDE Program Meeting (All-Hands Meeting) will take place on **April 4-5** at the Bethesdan Hilton Hotel in Bethesda, MD. Details and registration are available [here](https://nih-cfde.github.io/2023-april-all-hands-meeting/). We will bring together the CFDE community to review progress and discuss strategic issues that impact the ecosystem as a whole. For this meeting we are also planning a poster session, and some posters will be selected for lightning talks!

## Cross-Pollination Meeting
The next meeting is **Tuesday, May 2nd, at 2 pm ET/ 11 am PT**.  There will be no meeting in April as we will be holding the All-Hands Meeting. Regular Cross-Pollination events take place on the first Tuesday of every month. View the [Cross-Pollination Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQAeOLkivUZZnwZ_KxfGw3neezMaWbrPk9nnFiKfQGA/edit?usp=sharing) for more details. Email [support@cfde.atlassian.net](mailto:support@cfde.atlassian.net) if you would like to present.

## GitHub Security Update - 2FA Implementation
On **April 1** the CFDE GitHub will turn on 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) requirements for all CFDE associated repositories. Use the [Configuring 2FA on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) to update your account for access. Some users may already have this feature enabled. Users who do not will be removed from CFDE GitHub organization and will need to resubscribe after April 1st with 2FA enabled. This will not impact your access to other GitHub resources. If you have any questions, contact the [helpdesk](mailto:support@cfde.atlassian.net).

## C2M2 Submission Updates
Due to a delay in updating the submission prep script and ontology support and CV reference files, we are extending the deadline for Q1 2023 submissions by one week to **March 22, 2023**. All groups who would like to update their data must submit and approve it by this deadline.

If you would not like to update or submit new data, no action is required on your part. Previously submitted data will be included in this data release. If you have already submitted for March and the updates below are not relevant for your submission then what you have already submitted will be fine and you can ignore this. 

## NIH Funding Opportunities
The NIH Common Fund is interested in applications regarding two current funding opportunities:

**Administrative Supplements to Support the Exploration of Cloud in NIH-supported Research** ([NOT-OD-23-070](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-070.html)) The Office of Strategic Coordination has signed on to a joint announcement with participation by multiple NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices, with interest in applications that explore cloud solutions using datasets generated by one or more Common Fund programs.
