## SPARC Webinar: Tools for Integrative Physiological Modeling
A multi-institution team of dedicated scientists work to create the SPARC Portal, but how well do you know the team leaders? The Principal Investigators (PIs) play a pivotal role in shaping SPARC's vision to bridge the body and the brain. They spur the creation of an environment where data takes center stage and foster a culture of sharing and reuse.

[Join us](https://science.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e60c48f231a30b544eed731ea&id=5cdea05126&e=82138c187c) **Tuesday, December 12th** at 4:00 pm ET for a conversation sponsored by the American Physiological Society.
SPARC PIs Maryann Martone, PhD, and Peter Hunter, PhD, will explore the SCKAN knowledge base, SPARC knowledge graph and potential uses of the portal for the wider range of physiological processes.

## "SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D" Kaggle Competition

The “SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D” Kaggle competition is now LIVE at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation. The aim of this competition is to solve a fundamental problem in at least one organ, and to develop a first understanding of what vascular scaffold is needed to map senescent cells in tissue regions. A total prize amount of $80,000 (sponsored by Kaggle, [CIFAR](https://cifar.ca/), and [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home.html)) will be distributed among the five winning teams. You can join any time before **January 30, 2024**. Our welcome message [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation/discussion/452809) includes additional information and links. Please share this information widely! For questions, contact Nancy Ruschman: [nruschma@iu.edu](mailto:nruschma@iu.edu)

## 4DN Summer Internship Program
The 4DN Summer Undergraduate Program for Excellence in Research ([SUPER](https://www.4dnucleome.org/internship/)) is seeking applications for a paid summer research internship for undergraduate students. Students will be hosted by labs participating in the 4DN program, studying the structure and function of the nucleus. The individual opportunities are experimental, computational or both in labs using genomics, imaging or both. The internship will provide an opportunity for students to build connections, gain scientific skills, and conduct research. NIH encourages the participation of individuals from populations that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences. See the [Notice of NIH’s Interest in Diversity](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html). 

Eligible students are: 
- College Undergraduate Freshman through Seniors at a U.S. institution at the time of application
- Pursuing a major in a STEM field with a minimum 2.8 GPA
- A minimum of 18 years of age

Please visit the [program announcement](https://www.4dnucleome.org/internship/) for more details and to apply. Inquiries or requests for more information should be directed to [oh@4dnucleome.org](mailto:oh@4dnucleome.org).

## HuBMAP Summer Internship Program
The Underrepresented Student Internship Program provides the opportunity for undergraduate students from U.S. colleges and universities to receive mentorship and training from HuBMAP labs over the summer. Online applications are open and are due by **February 1st, 2024** [Download the flyer](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/files/13209400/HuBMAP.Internship.Flyer.pdf) for more details.

## CFDE Funding Opportunities
 **Short Courses to Promote the Broad and Rigorous Use of Common Fund Data (R25 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)**

CFDE is announcing the CFDE Research Education Program ([RFA-RM-23-014](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-014.html)), which aims to maximize the impact of these data and engage a broader community of end-users for wider adoption of Common Fund data sets. The program funded under this initiative will provide short courses on how to access, integrate, and interpret two or more Common Fund data sets in rigorous biomedical research designs, and mentoring activities to support the career development and retention of course trainees as long-term Common Fund data users. 

Applications are due  **February 14, 2024, by 5:00 PM** local time of the applicant organization.  

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Sahana Kukke at [sahana.kukke@nih.gov](mailto:sahana.kukke@nih.gov) with any additional questions.
