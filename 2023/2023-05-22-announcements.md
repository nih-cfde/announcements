## NIH Funding Opportunities -- https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem/FundingOpportunities
The NIH Common Fund is interested in applications regarding several current funding opportunities:

**NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Data Resource Center and Knowledge Center (OT2)** ([OTA-23-004](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/OTA-23-004.pdf)): This research opportunity will establish the CFDE Data Resource Center and Knowledge Center, which will each act to enable broad use of the data sets and knowledge generated by Common Fund programs. The CFDE Data Resource Center will develop and maintain the CFDE to enable users to learn about CFDE resources and query Common Fund data. The CFDE Knowledge Center will establish a knowledge network platform that integrates knowledge from different Common Fund programs to amplify their impact and improve accessibility to a wide user community. Applicants may choose to apply to establish either the Data Resource Center, the Knowledge Center, or both. Letters of intent, which are not required for eligibility to submit a full proposal but are strongly recommended, are due **April 28, 2023**. Webinar dates and registration information can be found on the [CFDE Frequently Asked Questions page](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem/faqs#webinars).
