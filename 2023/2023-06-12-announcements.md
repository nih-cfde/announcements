## LINCS News
In a new publication: https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00278-y in the journal Nature Cardiovascular Research: https://www.nature.com/natcardiovascres/ the Giannarelli Lab: https://med.nyu.edu/research/giannarelli-lab/ used CyTOF and RNA-seq to profile atherosclerotic plaques from post surgery samples from patients. Analyzing these data with the LINCS DCC tool L1000CDS2 https://maayanlab.cloud/L1000CDS2/#/index  it was predicted that saracatinib https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saracatinib a drug that was initially developed for cancer by AstraZeneca https://www.astrazeneca.com/ may have a positive effect on reducing plaque formation and improving patient outcomes. This study demonstrates how the NIH Common Fund https://commonfund.nih.gov/  Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures #LINCS data https://lincsproject.org/ can be utilized to advance drug and target discovery for complex human diseases. 

## Meeting Updates
