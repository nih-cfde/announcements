## SPARC Open Office Hours
The [SPARC Data and Resource Center (DRC)](https://science.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e60c48f231a30b544eed731ea&id=4b76240414&e=82138c187c) hosts regular [open office ](https://science.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e60c48f231a30b544eed731ea&id=3c8caf3cdc&e=82138c187c)[hours](https://science.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e60c48f231a30b544eed731ea&id=33675a6f3f&e=82138c187c) to support the scientific community. Each session is hosted by experts with a focus on a specific SPARC resource; however, we welcome all attendees to any open office hours. We will strive to answer your questions and point you to the appropriate resource.

## SPARC Webinar: Tools for Integrative Physiological Modeling
We’re pleased to invite you to the upcoming **December 12th** webinar, SPARC Tools for Integrative Physiological Modeling, presented by SPARC PI's Maryann Martone and Peter Hunter. In this webinar, Maryann Martone, PhD, and Peter Hunter, PhD, will explore the SCKAN knowledge base, SPARC Knowledge Graph and the potential uses of the portal for the wider range of physiological processes. The interactive program will allow the audience to discuss ways in which the portal may be developed to meet the needs of integrative physiological modeling. You won’t want to miss this exciting presentation!

## "SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D" Kaggle Competition

The “SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D” Kaggle competition is now LIVE at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation. The Cellular Senescence Program (SenNet) and the Human Organ Atlas (HOA) teams welcome contributions that help ​​​​improve 3D segmentation of vasculature. With better data on the healthy human vasculature, researchers will be able to simulate the flow of blood, oxygen, or even drugs through the vessel network. This is an exciting opportunity to get the world's best machine learning experts aware of SenNet and to work together on tissue segmentation for vascular structures, upon which senescence neighborhoods appear to be related (in at least some tissues). The aim is to solve a fundamental problem in at least one organ, and to develop a first understanding of what vascular scaffold is needed to map senescent cells in tissue regions.

A total prize amount of $80,000 (sponsored by Kaggle, [CIFAR](https://cifar.ca/), and [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home.html)) will be distributed among the five winning teams. You can join any time before **January 30, 2024**. Our welcome message [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation/discussion/452809) includes additional information and links. Please share this information widely!

## HuBMAP Summer Internship Program
The Underrepresented Student Internship Program provides the opportunity for undergraduate students from U.S. colleges and
universities to receive mentorship and training from HuBMAP labs over the summer. Online applications are open and are due by **February 1st, 2024** [Download the flyer](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/files/13209400/HuBMAP.Internship.Flyer.pdf) for more details.

## CFDE Funding Opportunities
 **Short Courses to Promote the Broad and Rigorous Use of Common Fund Data (R25 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)**

CFDE is announcing the CFDE Research Education Program ([RFA-RM-23-014](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-014.html)), which aims to maximize the impact of these data and engage a broader community of end-users for wider adoption of Common Fund data sets. The program funded under this initiative will provide short courses on how to access, integrate, and interpret two or more Common Fund data sets in rigorous biomedical research designs, and mentoring activities to support the career development and retention of course trainees as long-term Common Fund data users. 

Applications are due  **February 14, 2024, by 5:00 PM** local time of the applicant organization.  

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Sahana Kukke at [sahana.kukke@nih.gov](mailto:sahana.kukke@nih.gov) with any additional questions.
