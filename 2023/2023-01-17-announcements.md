## CFDE Funding Opportunity
Pilot Projects Enhancing Utility and Usage of Common Fund Data Sets (R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) (RFA-RM-23-003)

The goals of this funding opportunity announcement ([RFA-RM-23-003](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-003.html)) are to 1) promote the use of Common Fund data sets by supporting pilot studies based on analyses across two or more Common Fund program data sets; 2) enhance the utility of existing Common Fund data sets by developing workflows, analytic and simulation tools which will enable simultaneous analysis of multiple Common Fund data sets; and 3) demonstrate the added-value of integrating multiple Common Fund data resources in addressing biomedical research questions.
