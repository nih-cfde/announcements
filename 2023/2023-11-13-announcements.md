## "SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D" Kaggle Competition

The “SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D” Kaggle competition is now LIVE at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation. The Cellular Senescence Program (SenNet) and the Human Organ Atlas (HOA) teams welcome contributions that help ​​​​improve 3D segmentation of vasculature. With better data on the healthy human vasculature, researchers will be able to simulate the flow of blood, oxygen, or even drugs through the vessel network. The 3D segmentation data will also be valuable for understanding how blood vasculature changes for different sex, age, and BMI. Ultimately, 3D vessel segmentation data will help pave the way towards a more complete Vascular Common Coordinate Framework (VCCF) and Human Reference Atlas (HRA) for the healthy human body.

A total prize amount of $80,000 (sponsored by Kaggle, [CIFAR](https://cifar.ca/), and [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home.html)) will be distributed among the five winning teams. You can join any time before **January 30, 2024**. Our welcome message [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation/discussion/452809) includes additional information and links. Please share this information widely!

## HuBMAP Summer Internship Program
The Underrepresented Student Internship Program provides the opportunity for undergraduate students from U.S. colleges and
universities to receive mentorship and training from HuBMAP labs over the summer. Online applications open on **November 27th** and are due on **February 1st, 2024** [Download the flyer](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/files/13209400/HuBMAP.Internship.Flyer.pdf) for more details.

## CFDE Funding Opportunities
**Notice of Funding Opportunity ([RFA-RM-23-013](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-013.html))**, which seeks proposals for projects that involve collaboration with multiple Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to combine discovery and/or translational approaches with work that will enhance reusability of Common Fund data and contribute knowledge to the Common Fund Data Ecosystem. Proposed projects should improve the overall reuse potential of Common Fund data by developing and testing services needed to efficiently access, analyze, and, if necessary, integrate the data. Applications must involve a collaboration between at least two Common Fund DCCs listed in the Background section of the Notice and at least one external PI not currently funded by a CF program. 

Letters of intent are required for proposals requesting $500,000 or more in direct costs in any one budget year (excluding consortium and F&A costs), and are due **November 4, 2023** by 5:00 PM local time of the applicant organization. Full proposals are due **December 4, 2023**, by 5:00 PM local time of the applicant organization.

 **Notice of Funding Opportunity ([RFA-RM-23-015](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-015.html))**, Pilot Projects Enhancing Utility and Usage of Common Fund Data Sets (R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) which seeks pilot projects that will demonstrate and enhance the utility of selected Common Fund data sets, including generating hypotheses and catalyzing discoveries. Investigators are encouraged to utilize various approaches including, but not limited to, systems approaches, artificial intelligence (including generative)/machine learning/deep learning methods, advanced data science methods for data set integration and harmonization, and incorporating computational modeling to bring together high-throughput genotype and phenotype data sets. Proposed research plans must substantially leverage data from at least two eligible Common Fund programs detailed in the announcement.  

Full proposals are due  **November 17, 2023,  by 5:00 PM** local time of the applicant organization.   

Learn more on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website and contact the CFDE team at [CFDE@od.nih.gov](mailto:CFDE@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.
