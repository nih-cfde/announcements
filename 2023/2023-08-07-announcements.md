## CFDE Funding Opportunity
CFDE has announced a new Notice of Funding Opportunity ([RFA-RM-23-013](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-013.html)), which seeks proposals for projects that involve collaboration with multiple Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to combine discovery and/or translational approaches with work that will enhance reusability of Common Fund data and contribute knowledge to the Common Fund Data Ecosystem. Proposed projects should improve the overall re-use potential of Common Fund data by developing and testing services needed to efficiently access, analyze, and, if necessary, integrate the data. Applications must involve a collaboration between at least two Common Fund DCCs listed in the Background section of the Notice and at least one external PI not currently funded by a CF program.

There will be an informational webinar on **August 28th from 2-3 PM ET** for any interested applicants to learn more about the opportunity and ask questions directly to the CFDE team.
