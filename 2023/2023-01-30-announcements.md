## RFC Open for Comment

The [Establishing API standards and API interoperability across Common Fund DCCs towards the development of a Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_14rn_IB3C0lbxXXjNtvhrLn81cNNnQD/edit) RFC is now available for comment by the community until **February 3rd**.

RFC stands for “Requests for Comments”. These are proposals being made by members of the CFDE to suggest that the CFDE community as a whole adopt the suggested new best practice. Everyone in the community is invited to respond to these proposals by leaving comments, critiques, and support at the links above. Comments are open for one month at which point the documents will be reviewed. If there are no substantial objections to the RFC in that time, it will be adopted as a CFDE Best Practice. You can read more about our RFC process here.

## CFDE Funding Opportunity
Pilot Projects Enhancing Utility and Usage of Common Fund Data Sets (R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) (RFA-RM-23-003)

The goals of this funding opportunity announcement ([RFA-RM-23-003](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-003.html)) are to 1) promote the use of Common Fund data sets by supporting pilot studies based on analyses across two or more Common Fund program data sets; 2) enhance the utility of existing Common Fund data sets by developing workflows, analytic and simulation tools which will enable simultaneous analysis of multiple Common Fund data sets; and 3) demonstrate the added-value of integrating multiple Common Fund data resources in addressing biomedical research questions.

Eligible Common Fund Program Data Sets: [4D Nucleome (4DN)](https://commonfund.nih.gov/4dnucleome/), [Extracellular RNA Communication (ExRNA)](https://exrna.org/), [Gabriella First Kids First (KF)](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/), [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/), [Glycoscience (GL)](https://www.glygen.org/), [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org/), [Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG)](https://druggablegenome.net/), [Integrated Human Microbiome Project (iHMP)](https://hmpdacc.org/ihmp/), [Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2)](http://www.mousephenotype.org/), [Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)](http://lincsproject.org/), [Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/),[Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans (MoTrPAC)](https://motrpac-data.org/data-access),[Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC)](https://sparc.science/)
