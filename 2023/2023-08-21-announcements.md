## Virtual Workshop: Interoperable Workflows Using Workflow Management Systems and Singularity Containers

Sponsored by the National Institute of Health’s Common Fund Data Ecosystem, and in partnership with the HuBMAP Consortium and the Brain Image Library, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) is proud to present a workshop on using Common Workflow Language (CWL) to create interoperable workflows on **Wednesday September 6, 2023, 11am – 5pm ET.** 

The application deadline is **August 25, 2023**. Apply here: https://www.psc.edu/events/workshop-interoperable-workflows-using-cwl/

## Kids First ASHG Poster Session - An Invitation
The NIH [Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First)](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/) and [INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE (INCLUDE)](https://includedcc.org/) are hosting an ancillary poster session at the 2023 American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) Annual Meeting in Washington, DC on  **Wednesday, November 3 at 7:15 - 9:15 p.m. ET**. The theme of this meeting is “Accelerating Pediatric Genomics Research Through Collaboration.” Presentations will feature information about whole genome datasets from both programs, progress of Kids First and INCLUDE cohort projects, tools and functionalities of the Kids First Data Resource Portal and the INCLUDE Data Hub, and collaborations that can amplify the impact of Kids First and INCLUDE research efforts. Kids First is inviting all researchers whose work involves collaborations with or data use from Kids First and/or INCLUDE to present a poster with an overview of the research and, if you would like, information about how the Kids First and/or INCLUDE research communities can collaborate with you as well. You are welcome to reuse posters you have created in the past, a variety of poster sizes can be accommodated. If you have submitted a poster to the ASHG meeting, you are welcome to use it for this purpose as well.  

## CFDE Funding Opportunities
**Notice of Funding Opportunity ([RFA-RM-23-013](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-013.html))**, which seeks proposals for projects that involve collaboration with multiple Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to combine discovery and/or translational approaches with work that will enhance reusability of Common Fund data and contribute knowledge to the Common Fund Data Ecosystem. Proposed projects should improve the overall reuse potential of Common Fund data by developing and testing services needed to efficiently access, analyze, and, if necessary, integrate the data. Applications must involve a collaboration between at least two Common Fund DCCs listed in the Background section of the Notice and at least one external PI not currently funded by a CF program.

There will be an informational webinar on **August 28th from 2-3 PM ET** for any interested applicants to learn more about the opportunity and ask questions directly to the CFDE team. The registration link is here: https://bit.ly/CFDE_Partnerships_Webinar Learn more on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem/) website and contact the CFDE team at [CFDE@od.nih.gov](mailto:CFDE@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.

 **Notice of Funding Opportunity ([RFA-RM-23-015](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-015.html))**, Pilot Projects Enhancing Utility and Usage of Common Fund Data Sets (R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) which seeks pilot projects that will demonstrate and enhance the utility of selected Common Fund data sets, including generating hypotheses and catalyzing discoveries. Investigators are encouraged to utilize various approaches including, but not limited to, systems approaches, artificial intelligence (including generative)/machine learning/deep learning methods, advanced data science methods for data set integration and harmonization, and incorporating computational modeling to bring together high-throughput genotype and phenotype data sets. Proposed research plans must substantially leverage data from at least two eligible Common Fund programs detailed in the announcement.  

Full proposals are due  **November 17, 2023,  by 5:00 PM** local time of the applicant organization.
