## CFDE Funding Opportunity
CFDE has announced a new Notice of Funding Opportunity ([RFA-RM-23-013](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-013.html)), which seeks proposals for projects that involve collaboration with multiple Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to combine discovery and/or translational approaches with work that will enhance reusability of Common Fund data and contribute knowledge to the Common Fund Data Ecosystem. Proposed projects should improve the overall re-use potential of Common Fund data by developing and testing services needed to efficiently access, analyze, and, if necessary, integrate the data. Applications must involve a collaboration between at least two Common Fund DCCs listed in the Background section of the Notice and at least one external PI not currently funded by a CF program.

Letters of intent are required for proposals requesting $500,000 or more in direct costs in any one budget year (excluding consortium and F&A costs), and are due **November 4, 2023** by 5:00 PM local time of the applicant organization. Full proposals are due December 4, 2023, by 5:00 PM local time of the applicant organization.

Learn more on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem/) website and contact the CFDE team at [CFDE@od.nih.gov](mailto:CFDE@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.

Please keep a lookout for updated invites in your e-mail feed to make sure you have the most up-to-date invitations on your calendar. Remember also that you can always rely on meeting agendas for links and scheduling, or contact the helpdesk (support@cfde.atlassian.net) if any issues arise.
