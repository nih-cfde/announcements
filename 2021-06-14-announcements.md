# CFDE Announcements

## Cross-Pollination Events
The next scheduled meeting is **Tuesday, July 6th**. Regular Cross-Pollination events take place on the first Tuesday of every month. Please check out the [Cross-Pollination Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQAeOLkivUZZnwZ_KxfGw3neezMaWbrPk9nnFiKfQGA/edit?usp=sharing) and let us know if you would like to present! Please contact us today if you are interested in presenting at support@cfde.atlassian.net.

## CFDE Trainings and Workshops

On **June 16th** at **10am PDT**, join us and the LINCS Project for a 1-hour demonstration of using Appyters, which are web-based customizable Jupyter notebooks executed in the cloud, to generate downstream visualization and enrichment analysis from a list of differentially expressed genes.  Appyters can be applied to a variety of workflows including building customized machine learning pipelines, analyzing omics data, and producing publishable figures. [Click Here to Register](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/pop-up-series-introduction-to-rnaseq-related-appyters/?pk_campaign=anc).

On **June 21st and 23rd** we will host a two part (2 hour sessions each) workshop series that will provide hands-on experience in conducting basic RNA-Seq analysis in the cloud. We’ll go over how to process RNA-Seq data and cover the basics of differential gene expression and data visualization in R. This workshop will be conducted remotely via Zoom. The workshop Zoom link will be emailed to participants after registration closes. Participants should plan to fill out a brief survey before and after the workshop. Register here:
June 21st: [RNA-Seq in the Cloud Part I](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/rnaseq-in-the-cloud-2021-06-21/?pk_campaign=anc)
June 22nd: [RNA-Seq in the Cloud Part II](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/rnaseq-in-the-cloud-2021-06-23/?pk_campaign=anc) 

Please check out the [CFDE Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/?pk_campaign=anc) to find and register for these and other future events. Our workshops are open to all, so feel free to share this information with interested friends and colleagues.

## Post-Doc Opportunity

The Fair Data Informatics (FDI) Laboratory is looking for a knowledge engineering Post-Doc (apply@fdilab.org) at the University of California, San Diego with a background in Computer Science, Informatics or a related field. This Post-Doc will be responsible for knowledge engineering and supporting systems involved in the querying, viewing, federating, analyzing, and managing of bio-medical ontologies and the use of these ontologies in the annotation of primary research data and the representation of knowledge extracted from this data related to NIH Common Fund projects. See https://www.fdilab.org/positions-available for more information
