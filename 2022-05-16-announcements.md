## LINCS  Publication
The LINCS DCIC published a paper in the 2022 webserver issue of Nucleic Acid Research (https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkac328/6582159?login=false) describing the SigCom LINCS web portal (https://maayanlab.cloud/sigcom-lincs/#/). SigCom LINCS serves over a million gene expression signatures processed, analyzed, and visualized from LINCS, GTEx, and GEO. It is built with Signature Commons (https://github.com/MaayanLab/signature-commons), a cloud-agnostic skeleton Data Commons with a focus on serving searchable signatures. SigCom LINCS is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) with metadata linked to standard ontologies and vocabularies. In addition, all the data and signatures within SigCom LINCS are available via a well-documented API (https://smart-api.info/registry?q=sigcom).

## FASEB DataWorks! Prize
The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) the National Institutes of Health are championing a bold vision of data sharing and reuse. The DataWorks! Prize fuels this vision with an annual challenge that showcases the benefits of research data management while recognizing and rewarding teams whose research demonstrates the power of data sharing and reuse practices to advance scientific discovery and human health. They are seeking new and innovative approaches to data sharing and reuse in biological and biomedical research. The [2022 DataWorks! Prize](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.icptrack.com%2Ficp%2Frelay.php%3Fr%3D40524122%26msgid%3D389205%26act%3D35CB%26c%3D1433802%26pid%3D955646%26destination%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.herox.com%252Fdataworks%26cf%3D6604%26v%3D6b0f294cee7c2f90194a34fd0dd74ee3c9c164baeb31cd692265b1511c46b12b&data=05%7C01%7Chaluk.resat%40nih.gov%7C590f60c97951402974a108da337057aa%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C637878854846540848%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=o5fRCMPp%2Fs1Whz2WnBg66SXyPLiA%2F9KUu23tekeXavY%3D&reserved=0) will distribute up to $500,000 in awards.
