## Bridge2AI Opportunity
We are excited to announce that the NIH has issued a Research Opportunity Announcement (ROA) for Data Generation Projects for the Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Program (OT2). This ROA is soliciting Data Generation Projects to create flagship datasets based on ethical principles, associated standards and tools, and skills and workforce development to address biomedical and behavioral research grand challenges that require artificial intelligence and machine-learning (AI/ML) analysis. The Bridge2AI program plans to support the formation of teams richly diverse in perspectives, backgrounds, and academic and technical disciplines. This ROA requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP)--a summary of strategies to advance the scientific and technical merit of the proposed project(s) through inclusivity. Visit the [Bridge2AI Program Resources page](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai/programresources),
[Building Diverse Teams page](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai/enhancingdiverseperspectives), and [Program FAQs](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai/faqs) for additional information on building diverse teams and for PEDP guidance. 

Please refer to the research opportunity announcement for additional information on application submission and review ([OTA-21-008](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/OT2-Data-Generation-Projects-B2AI-051321-508.pdf)). Inquiries can be sent to the Bridge2AI program team at bridge2AI@od.nih.gov. A Letter of Intent (LOI) is required, LOIs must be emailed to bridge2ai@od.nih.gov by 11:59 PM ET on or before July 20, 2021.
