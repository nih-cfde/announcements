## NIH Common Fund - Funding Opportunities

### NCPI Administrative Coordinating Center
The NIH has announced the release of a [Research Opportunity Announcement](https://datascience.nih.gov/news/nih-cloud-platform-interoperability-administrative-coordinating-center) (ROA) to establish the Administrative Coordinating Center for the NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) Program. Significant resources are being invested into the generation of large-scale biomedical datasets. Many of these data are stored in different cloud-based repositories stewarded by individual institutes and centers. The goal of NCPI is to enable a federated data ecosystem that will facilitate researcher-driven analyses of datasets across multiple cloud-based platforms and repositories.

This ROA aims to establish the NCPI Administrative Coordination Center (ACC), which will provide technical, administrative, coordination, and project management support across NCPI participants and collaborators. The primary responsibility of the ACC will be to support the NIH in identifying, prioritizing, and overseeing interoperability projects, which are technical projects that are driven by scientific use cases that leverage datasets from multiple NIH cloud repositories. Additionally, the ACC will have wide-ranging responsibilities that include supporting of the creation and maintenance of communication and training materials, organizing and facilitating events related to NCPI activities, providing project management for NCPI interoperability projects and working groups, monitoring of progress and milestones, supporting the NIH in developing good governance practices, and supporting the onboarding of new partner platforms.

Please consider this opportunity, if relevant. Letters of Intent (LOIs) are due by April 15th. Both LOIs and questions can be submitted to [ncpi-info@od.nih.gov](mailto:ncpi-info@od.nih.gov)
