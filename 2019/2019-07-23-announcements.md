Happy Tuesday! GitHub was experiencing some issues yesterday, so the announcements are a little delayed.

## Input Wanted

The CFDE July report is due to the NIH in a little over a week, and many people have been working together to collate
information from DCC websites into useful tables. If you have some free time, please check out the work that's been done
and help us double check the entries for accuracy and readability:

- [FAIRness chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10C_TfqLwcJ6_oTdM1a0Yl0hrBr58bMHDqXSORoApy3k/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Several Summary tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ILmPQlwW9qYdbMGBoB42vs0bb_tw2psWh6rdY0FbZTg/edit#gid=0)

## Contributing

You can contribute to next week's announcements by commenting on [the open
announcements issue in this repository](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Announcements)

Have a great week!
