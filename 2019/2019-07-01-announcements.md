# CFDE Weekly Announcements

## Reports

The CFDE Engagement team visited Kids First last week and learned a lot about their organization. You can view the preliminary findings [in this powerpoint.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ohydBrWuaHXuWddxgxTg1EXsYD2Vhm_iFfRHTKMsgDE/edit?usp=sharing)
A more in-depth report will be available in the coming weeks

## Input Wanted

As part of our DCC engagement, Brian O'Connor is accessing aspects of Single Sign On: What DCCs have now, what they've tried, and where they might go from here. He has some preliminary results [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EBTSknWqsxdxFhs1Nkk3LG2hAbFRt8u2NCMYU5oLvm4/edit?usp=sharing), and would value input on both what he's gathered so far, and what other questions he might explore.
