# CFDE Announcements

## Updates

- We have a website wireframe for the upcoming public facing CFDE site. It is currently loaded with some demo content from the old DCPPC site. You can download the mockup [here](https://github.com/nih-cfde/public-website-mockups). Please add comments, questions and suggestions for the site as [issues](https://github.com/nih-cfde/public-website-mockups/issues). We will be working to populate the site with CFDE content in the coming months. If you have content you would like added, please follow the instructions at the [website content repo](https://github.com/nih-cfde/public-website-content). 

- The Technical Team will be demoing portal capability to the NIH this Friday. 

## From the Web

The NIH has a [blogpost](http://nlmdirector.nlm.nih.gov/2019/09/18/enhancing-data-sharing-one-dataset-at-a-time) about their data sharing vision that you may find interesting.

## Requests

We would like to build a collection of ideas for how the CFDE tech products might look. Potential products include a CFDE search plugin, User Helpbot, CFDE Portal, CFDE Dashboard, and CFDE Documentation site. For the first stage, we simply want a mass gathering of ideas, screenshots, musings, napkin drawings, etc that capture what features they should have, what a user interaction should feel like, etc. In general, focus on content/usability over fonts/color schemes for examples, although if you have a great design idea, we want that too :).

A description of each product and instructions on how to submit ideas can be found in the [Brainstorming Starting Point google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-l-zFDbOw-hVeTizRwrQY1zi54trMlskApEv1Vt9h8/edit).

## Reminders

[August MPQs](https://forms.gle/YE85EYqRRDgRDkp27) and financial reports are overdue. Please make sure your team has both submitted asap.
