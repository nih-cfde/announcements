## CFDE Funding Opportunities
### **NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Training Center (OT2) – OTA-24-004** 

The CF is announcing a funding opportunity to establish the [Training Center (TC)](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/OTA-24-004.pdf) for the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE). This center will be responsible for identifying and addressing the training opportunities and needs of the CFDE community. The TC team must effectively and productively collaborate with the CFDE investigators and the ecosystem's other components. The TC will promote the use and reuse of CF resources by creating and implementing activities addressing three target training-related functions: training and mentoring, coordination of CFDE training activities, and web infrastructure.  

Applications are due  **April 1, 2024**,  by 5:00 PM local time of the applicant organization.  

An informational webinar about this announcement will be hosted on  **February 16, 2024**: 2 PM – 3 PM ET. Webinar registration information can be found on the [CFDE Frequently Asked Questions page](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem/faqs#webinars). 

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Sahana Kukke at [sahana.kukke@nih.gov](mailto:sahana.kukke@nih.gov) and [CFDE@od.nih.gov](mailto:CFDE@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.

### **Short Courses to Promote the Broad and Rigorous Use of Common Fund Data (R25 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)**

CFDE is announcing the CFDE Research Education Program ([RFA-RM-23-014](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-014.html)), which aims to maximize the impact of these data and engage a broader community of end-users for wider adoption of Common Fund data sets. Applicants will develop a program that provides short courses on how to access, integrate, and interpret two or more Common Fund data sets in rigorous biomedical research designs, and mentoring activities to support the career development and retention of course trainees as long-term Common Fund data users. 

Applications are due **February 14, 2024, by 5:00 PM** local time of the applicant organization.   

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Sahana Kukke at [sahana.kukke@nih.gov](mailto:sahana.kukke@nih.gov) with any additional questions.

## Request for Information
### Increasing the Usability of Common Fund Data Resources by Researchers from Underrepresented Groups 

The Common Fund released a Request For Information ([RFI: NOT-RM-24-001](https://go.nih.gov/CF-Data-Engagement)) to gather input from the public to prepare for an upcoming community engagement workshop. The workshop, planned for the summer of 2024, will address ways to engage a broader population of researchers in the use of Common Fund data. 

All responses are due  **February 29, 2024**,  by 5:00 PM ET. Email the Common Fund team at [commonfundworkshop@od.nih.gov](mailto:commonfundworkshop@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.

## Internships & Fellowships

### 4DN Summer Internship Program
The 4DN Summer Undergraduate Program for Excellence in Research ([SUPER](https://www.4dnucleome.org/internship/)) is seeking applications for a paid summer research internship for undergraduate students. Students will be hosted by labs participating in the 4DN program, studying the structure and function of the nucleus. The individual opportunities are experimental, computational or both in labs using genomics, imaging or both. The internship will provide an opportunity for students to build connections, gain scientific skills, and conduct research. NIH encourages the participation of individuals from populations that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences. See the [Notice of NIH’s Interest in Diversity](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html). Please visit the [program announcement](https://www.4dnucleome.org/internship/) for more details and to apply. Applications are due **February 16th**. Inquiries or requests for more information should be directed to [oh@4dnucleome.org](mailto:oh@4dnucleome.org).

### NIH Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias (CARD) Fellowship
We are currently recruiting for a [fully paid Master’s in Data Science Fellowship](https://card.nih.gov/job-training-opportunities/training-opportunities/data-science-masters). The application deadline is the end of the day on **April 22, 2024**.

This opportunity allows students to earn an MPS degree in data science while earning a full stipend to work at CARD with real-world data in the dementia space, working to explore the genetic architecture of disease from a data science perspective. This program is a collaboration with NIH FAES and UMBC. We are particularly passionate about recruiting diverse fellows.  We have a blog post featuring interviews with current MPS in Data Science Fellows at CARD – students can learn what it’s like to be in the program: https://card.nih.gov/news-events/card-news/what-its-be-masters-data-science-student-nih-card. Prospective fellows can learn more about this opportunity and apply here: https://faes.org/CARD-FAES-UMBC_Fellowship.
