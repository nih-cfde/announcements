## "SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D" Kaggle Competition
The “SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D” Kaggle competition is now LIVE at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation. The aim of this competition is to solve a fundamental problem in at least one organ, and to develop a first understanding of what vascular scaffold is needed to map senescent cells in tissue regions. A total prize amount of $80,000 (sponsored by Kaggle, [CIFAR](https://cifar.ca/), and [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home.html)) will be distributed among the five winning teams. You can join any time before **January 30, 2024**. Our welcome message [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation/discussion/452809) includes additional information and links. Please share this information widely! For questions, contact Nancy Ruschman: [nruschma@iu.edu](mailto:nruschma@iu.edu)

## GlyGen-CFDE Summer Internship Program
The GlyGen-CFDE project is seeking applications for a paid 8-week summer research in-person internship in 2024 for undergraduate and graduate students in Washington DC at George Washington University. This 8-week internship program is tailored to provide hands-on experience in bioinformatics and biology applications in biomedical research through Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) and GlyGen tools and data. Interns will have the opportunity to expand their understanding of biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics concepts, including exploration and analysis of glycans, proteins, and biomarkers while working on tasks and projects, enabling them to find answers to specific biological questions. The internship will provide benefits such as professional networking, soft skills development, hands-on experience in bioinformatics programming, data wrangling, and exploration of biomedical web resources and tools. 

Please visit the [internship announcement](https://wiki.glygen.org/index.php?title=GlyGen_Internships%2FGlyGen-CFDE_Summer_2024_Internship_Program_Announcement) for more details and to apply. The last date to apply is **January 31, 2024**.

## SenNet Consortium Undergraduate Student Program (CUSP)
SenNet is actively recruiting students for the **May-August 2024** cohort of the Consortium Undergraduate Student Program (CUSP). CUSP is a summer research internship program for undergraduate students hosted by laboratories participating in the NIH Common Fund’s Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet). The application deadline is **January 25**. Interested students can always reach out to [cusp@sennetconsortium.org] or visit https://sennetconsortium.org/internship/ for application information and eligibility requirements. We're looking forward to an excellent summer with the 2024 CUSP interns! 

## 4DN Summer Internship Program
The 4DN Summer Undergraduate Program for Excellence in Research ([SUPER](https://www.4dnucleome.org/internship/)) is seeking applications for a paid summer research internship for undergraduate students. Students will be hosted by labs participating in the 4DN program, studying the structure and function of the nucleus. The individual opportunities are experimental, computational or both in labs using genomics, imaging or both. The internship will provide an opportunity for students to build connections, gain scientific skills, and conduct research. NIH encourages the participation of individuals from populations that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences. See the [Notice of NIH’s Interest in Diversity](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html). Please visit the [program announcement](https://www.4dnucleome.org/internship/) for more details and to apply. Inquiries or requests for more information should be directed to [oh@4dnucleome.org](mailto:oh@4dnucleome.org).

## HuBMAP Summer Internship Program
The Underrepresented Student Internship Program provides the opportunity for undergraduate students from U.S. colleges and universities to receive mentorship and training from HuBMAP labs over the summer. Online applications are open and are due by **February 1st, 2024**. [Download the flyer](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/files/13209400/HuBMAP.Internship.Flyer.pdf) for more details.

## CFDE Funding Opportunities
 **Short Courses to Promote the Broad and Rigorous Use of Common Fund Data (R25 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)**

CFDE is announcing the CFDE Research Education Program ([RFA-RM-23-014](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-014.html)), which aims to maximize the impact of these data and engage a broader community of end-users for wider adoption of Common Fund data sets. Applicants will develop a program that provides short courses on how to access, integrate, and interpret two or more Common Fund data sets in rigorous biomedical research designs, and mentoring activities to support the career development and retention of course trainees as long-term Common Fund data users. 

Applications are due **February 14, 2024, by 5:00 PM** local time of the applicant organization.   

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Sahana Kukke at [sahana.kukke@nih.gov](mailto:sahana.kukke@nih.gov) with any additional questions.
