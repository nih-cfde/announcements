## CFDE Funding Opportunities

### **NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Cloud Workspace Implementation Center (OT2)– OTA-24-005** 

The CF is announcing a funding opportunity ([OTA-24-005](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/OTA-24-005.pdf)) to establish the Cloud Workspace Implementation Center (CWIC) for the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE). The CWIC will create a synergistic cloud workspace that enables users to import their data and co-analyze them together with other Common Fund data sets. The cloud workspace will also enable the use of CFDE-constructed pipelines, workflows, and other analysis and visualization resources. It will meet the needs of both novice and expert users.  

Applications are due  **April 22, 2024**,  by 5:00 PM local time of the applicant organization.   

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Anthony Kirilusha at [anthony.kirilusha@nih.gov](mailto:anthony.kirilusha@nih.gov) and [CFDE@od.nih.gov](mailto:CFDE@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.   

### **NIH Common Fund: Research supplements to promote workforce diversity and enhance utility and use of Common Fund datasets (NOT-RM-24-003)** 

The  [NIH Common Fund](https://commonfund.nih.gov/) (CF) has signed onto [PA-23-189](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-23-189.html) and is accepting applications regarding a Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): [NOT-RM-24-003](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-24-003.html). To maximize the impact of Common Fund data and to engage a broader, more diverse community of end-users, eligible applicants must (1) substantially leverage data from at least one Common Fund program and (2) promote the diversity of researchers using data generated by these programs. See the list of eligible Common Fund datasets on [announcement page](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-24-003.html). 

Applications are due  **April 8, 2024**, by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.

### **NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Training Center (OT2) – OTA-24-004** 

The CF is announcing a funding opportunity to establish the [Training Center (TC)](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/OTA-24-004.pdf) for the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE). This center will be responsible for identifying and addressing the training opportunities and needs of the CFDE community. The TC team must effectively and productively collaborate with the CFDE investigators and the ecosystem's other components. The TC will promote the use and reuse of CF resources by creating and implementing activities addressing three target training-related functions: training and mentoring, coordination of CFDE training activities, and web infrastructure.  

Applications are due  **April 1, 2024**,  by 5:00 PM local time of the applicant organization.  

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Sahana Kukke at [sahana.kukke@nih.gov](mailto:sahana.kukke@nih.gov) and [CFDE@od.nih.gov](mailto:CFDE@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.

### NIH Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias (CARD) Fellowship
We are currently recruiting for a [fully paid Master’s in Data Science Fellowship](https://card.nih.gov/job-training-opportunities/training-opportunities/data-science-masters). The application deadline is the end of the day on **April 22, 2024**.

This opportunity allows students to earn an MPS degree in data science while earning a full stipend to work at CARD with real-world data in the dementia space, working to explore the genetic architecture of disease from a data science perspective. This program is a collaboration with NIH FAES and UMBC. We are particularly passionate about recruiting diverse fellows.  We have a blog post featuring interviews with current MPS in Data Science Fellows at CARD – students can learn what it’s like to be in the program: https://card.nih.gov/news-events/card-news/what-its-be-masters-data-science-student-nih-card. Prospective fellows can learn more about this opportunity and apply here: https://faes.org/CARD-FAES-UMBC_Fellowship.
