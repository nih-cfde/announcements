# CFDE Announcements

## Coordination Updates
A lot of work is going on to transfer coordination responsibilities from the old CC to the new ICC. Many systems and platforms will be changing hands and new meeting invites will be issued for CFDE meetings starting in May. Please keep an eye out for new invitations as the Zoom links and Calendar invitations will be new. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work on the transition to Phase II of the CFDE! 

## IMPC Data API Workshop
Registration is now open for the 2nd workshop in the IMPC Workshop series 2024. It is taking place online on Monday, **May 20th 2024** from 16:00-18:00 CET/ 15:00-17:00 UK /10:00-12:00 EDT/ 07:00-09:00 PDT.

The target audience for the workshop would be people familiar with mouse biology and IMPC data to some extent, with some basic knowledge of programming and data transformation, but not necessarily knowledge of using an Apache Solr API. The objective of the course would be to enable people to construct simple Solr API queries to obtain IMPC data based on an understanding of the structure of IMPC data, specifically how knowledge of IMPReSS can be used together with the Solr API to extract datasets from IMPC. After the course people should be able to automate tasks that could be accomplished through the website by looking manually at multiple web pages.

Registration is free [here](https://nih.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJItduGoqTkjH5cTdKi7-0Q8qATCs1d67uc)

## CFDE Funding Opportunities

### **NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Cloud Workspace Implementation Center (OT2)– OTA-24-005** 
The CF is announcing a funding opportunity ([OTA-24-005](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/OTA-24-005.pdf)) to establish the Cloud Workspace Implementation Center (CWIC) for the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE). The CWIC will create a synergistic cloud workspace that enables users to import their data and co-analyze them together with other Common Fund data sets. The cloud workspace will also enable the use of CFDE-constructed pipelines, workflows, and other analysis and visualization resources. It will meet the needs of both novice and expert users.  

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Anthony Kirilusha at [anthony.kirilusha@nih.gov](mailto:anthony.kirilusha@nih.gov) and [CFDE@od.nih.gov](mailto:CFDE@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.   

Applications are due  **April 22, 2024**,  by 5:00 PM local time of the applicant organization.
