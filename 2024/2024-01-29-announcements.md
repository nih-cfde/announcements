## Internships & Fellowships

### GlyGen-CFDE Summer Internship Program
The GlyGen-CFDE project is seeking applications for a paid 8-week summer research in-person internship in 2024 for undergraduate and graduate students in Washington DC at George Washington University. This 8-week internship program is tailored to provide hands-on experience in bioinformatics and biology applications in biomedical research through Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) and GlyGen tools and data. Interns will have the opportunity to expand their understanding of biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics concepts, including exploration and analysis of glycans, proteins, and biomarkers while working on tasks and projects, enabling them to find answers to specific biological questions. The internship will provide benefits such as professional networking, soft skills development, hands-on experience in bioinformatics programming, data wrangling, and exploration of biomedical web resources and tools. 

Please visit the [internship announcement](https://wiki.glygen.org/index.php?title=GlyGen_Internships%2FGlyGen-CFDE_Summer_2024_Internship_Program_Announcement) for more details and to apply. The last date to apply is **January 31, 2024**.

### HuBMAP Summer Internship Program
The Undergraduate Student Internship Program provides the opportunity for undergraduate students from U.S. colleges and universities to receive mentorship and training from HuBMAP labs over the summer. Online applications are open and are due by **February 1st, 2024**. [Download the flyer](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/files/13209400/HuBMAP.Internship.Flyer.pdf) for more details.

### 4DN Summer Internship Program
The 4DN Summer Undergraduate Program for Excellence in Research ([SUPER](https://www.4dnucleome.org/internship/)) is seeking applications for a paid summer research internship for undergraduate students. Students will be hosted by labs participating in the 4DN program, studying the structure and function of the nucleus. The individual opportunities are experimental, computational or both in labs using genomics, imaging or both. The internship will provide an opportunity for students to build connections, gain scientific skills, and conduct research. NIH encourages the participation of individuals from populations that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences. See the [Notice of NIH’s Interest in Diversity](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html). Please visit the [program announcement](https://www.4dnucleome.org/internship/) for more details and to apply. Applications are due **February 16th**. Inquiries or requests for more information should be directed to [oh@4dnucleome.org](mailto:oh@4dnucleome.org).

### NIH Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias (CARD) Fellowship
We are currently recruiting for a [fully paid Master’s in Data Science Fellowship](https://card.nih.gov/job-training-opportunities/training-opportunities/data-science-masters). The application deadline is the end of the day on **April 22, 2024**.

This opportunity allows students to earn an MPS degree in data science while earning a full stipend to work at CARD with real-world data in the dementia space, working to explore the genetic architecture of disease from a data science perspective. This program is a collaboration with NIH FAES and UMBC. We are particularly passionate about recruiting diverse fellows.  We have a blog post featuring interviews with current MPS in Data Science Fellows at CARD – students can learn what it’s like to be in the program: https://card.nih.gov/news-events/card-news/what-its-be-masters-data-science-student-nih-card. Prospective fellows can learn more about this opportunity and apply here: https://faes.org/CARD-FAES-UMBC_Fellowship.

## CFDE Funding Opportunity
### **Short Courses to Promote the Broad and Rigorous Use of Common Fund Data (R25 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)**

CFDE is announcing the CFDE Research Education Program ([RFA-RM-23-014](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-23-014.html)), which aims to maximize the impact of these data and engage a broader community of end-users for wider adoption of Common Fund data sets. Applicants will develop a program that provides short courses on how to access, integrate, and interpret two or more Common Fund data sets in rigorous biomedical research designs, and mentoring activities to support the career development and retention of course trainees as long-term Common Fund data users. 

Applications are due **February 14, 2024, by 5:00 PM** local time of the applicant organization.   

More information can be found on the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem) website. Email Dr. Sahana Kukke at [sahana.kukke@nih.gov](mailto:sahana.kukke@nih.gov) with any additional questions.

## Request for Information
### Increasing the Usability of Common Fund Data Resources by Researchers from Underrepresented Groups 

The Common Fund released a Request For Information ([RFI: NOT-RM-24-001](https://go.nih.gov/CF-Data-Engagement)) to gather input from the public to prepare for an upcoming community engagement workshop. The workshop, planned for the summer of 2024, will address ways to engage a broader population of researchers in the use of Common Fund data. 

All responses are due  **February 29, 2024**,  by 5:00 PM ET. Email the Common Fund team at [commonfundworkshop@od.nih.gov](mailto:commonfundworkshop@od.nih.gov) with any additional questions.
