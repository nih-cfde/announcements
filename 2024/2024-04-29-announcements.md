# CFDE Announcements

## CFDE Coordination Changes
The CFDE Coordination Center has served to build, organize, coordinate, and integrate teams and activities across the CFDE for five years.  This week we are turning over a large part of this vital work to the new Integration and Coordination Center (ICC). The CFDE Helpdesk ([support@cfde.atlassian.net](mailto:support@cfde.atlassian.net)) will still be available for questions and concerns about CFDE business. We wish the ICC and all of you the best as you embark on Phase 2 of the Common Fund Data Ecosystem journey.

## Meeting Updates
Many systems and platforms have changed hands and new meeting invites will be issued for CFDE meetings starting in May. Please keep an eye out for new invitations as the Zoom links and Calendar invitations will be new. All Coordination Center organized meetings (monthly NIH-DCC, Ontology WG, Steering Committee) have had the links and calendar invites cancelled. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work on the transition to Phase II of the CFDE! 

## IMPC Data API Workshop
Registration is now open for the 2nd workshop in the IMPC Workshop series 2024. It is taking place online on Monday, **May 20th, 2024** from 16:00-18:00 CET/ 15:00-17:00 UK /10:00-12:00 EDT/ 07:00-09:00 PDT.

The target audience for the workshop would be people familiar with mouse biology and IMPC data to some extent, with some basic knowledge of programming and data transformation, but not necessarily knowledge of using an Apache Solr API. The objective of the course would be to enable people to construct simple Solr API queries to obtain IMPC data based on an understanding of the structure of IMPC data, specifically how knowledge of IMPReSS can be used together with the Solr API to extract datasets from IMPC. After the course, people should be able to automate tasks that could be accomplished through the website by looking manually at multiple web pages.

More information on the workshop [here](https://www.mousephenotype.org/blog/2024/04/10/impc-data-api-workshop/)
