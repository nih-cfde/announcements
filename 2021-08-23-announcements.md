# CFDE Announcements

## Cross-Pollination Events
Our next scheduled meeting will take place on **September 7th**.  Please contact us today if you are interested in presenting at an upcoming event at support@cfde.atlassian.net! Regular Cross-Pollination events take place on the first Tuesday of every month. Please check out the  [Cross-Pollination Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQAeOLkivUZZnwZ_KxfGw3neezMaWbrPk9nnFiKfQGA/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

## IDG Hackathon
The Knowledge Management Center (KMC), as part of IDG, is hosting an upcoming IDG Hackathon on Aug. 31-Sept. 1, 2021.  It will take place virtually. This Hackathon will aim to produce informatic tools and/or workflows in IDG to explore Phenotype/disease/protein function imputations by utilizing: 
1. Appyters and KnowledGraph methodologies and 
2. Structural Biology evolution and prediction knowledge

## Funding Opportunities
In August, NHGRI published three FOA’s that together request applications proposing a five-year pilot effort whose long-term goal is to catalog the molecular and cellular phenotypes resulting from null alleles of genes in human cells. MorPhiC Phase 1 will target 1000 loci for gene knock-outs; explore multiple molecular and cellular assays; develop analyses to help understand the utility of, and requirements for, the data, and to distribute the results to the community. 

The overall goal of Phase 1 is to reveal and understand the key challenges in scaling up such an effort to the whole genome, including: optimization of mutagenesis; scalability and informativeness of assays;  limitations of interpretation; biological or other variability; develop data quality standards and data formats; and explore the range of uses for the data, alone and in combination with other genomic data types. This will inform a possible second phase.

## CFDE Trainings and Workshops
The CFDE Training Team in collaboration with the [UC Davis DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/eventscalendar/introduction-to-remote-computing-11-part-series-workshop-1-intro-to-shell/) is hosting an 11-part workshop series in August. The course introduces attendees to the principles and practice of remote computing with UNIX on workstations, HPCs, and cloud. Topics include shell, editing remote files, ssh, remote file transfer, software installation with conda, project organization, automating analyses, cluster compute with slurm, and cloud compute with AWS. This pilot workshop series is already completely booked, but you can still explore the [CFDE Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/?pk_campaign=anc) to find and register for other future events. Our workshops are open to all, so feel free to share this information with interested friends and colleagues. Questions? Contact us at training@cfde.atlassian.net

## Working Group Updates

### Ontology Working Group
The next meeting for the Ontology Working Group is scheduled for **Wednesday, August 25 at 8am PDT / 11am EDT**. Ontology Working Group meetings are scheduled bi-weekly on Wednesdays. RFC and Survey 'homework' tasks can be found in the [rolling agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VoHHBeWfol6XNJa3kzOnOFuTaIrcLYbqKYQcOnj1oh4/edit#heading=h.3ia46913z0oa). You can get involved by joining their [mailing list](https://cfdepublic.groups.io/g/OntologyWorkingGroup) and [slack channel](https://cfdeworkspace.slack.com/archives/C01GP14DLJX.).
