## New RFC Open for Comment

The [Use of Uberon for anatomy in the C2M2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-KYUOvzO6NMiHqnl9G8JzakLcqJbkfG/edit)  RFC is now available for comment by the community until December 15th 

RFC stands for “Requests for Comments”. These are proposals being made by members of the CFDE to suggest that the CFDE community as a whole adopt the suggested new best practice. Everyone in the community is invited to respond to these proposals by leaving comments, critiques, and support at the links above. Comments are open for one month at which point the documents will be reviewed. If there are no substantial objections to the RFC in that time, it will be adopted as a CFDE Best Practice. You can read more about our RFC process [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1masYhU6W_zgUWN1XWS8_f-KiSp1cTDdo4eZJWpsXyHQ/edit).

## NIH RFI Opportunity
Search Capabilities across the Biomedical Landscape for NIH-wide Data Discovery, NOT-OD-21-187: this RFI seeks input on use cases, expectations, and capabilities for enabling data and information discovery (search) to enhance NIH-wide data discovery and its reuse. In particular, NIH would like to understand better researchers’ experiences and expectations in finding data and information that would greatly enable their research capabilities and uncover underlying barriers or opportunities that can move the search landscape forward. All comments must be submitted to https://datascience.nih.gov/search-capabilities-across-the-biomedical-landscape by December 3rd.
