## Releases

The CFDE Training Site had an update for the end of the year adding two new tutorials and a battery of fixes and re-designed features. The latest tutorials are [**Simulate Illumina Reads**](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/Bioinformatics-Skills/Simulate_Illumina_Reads/) and [**Uploading Data to Cavatica**](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/Bioinformatics-Skills/Kids-First/Upload_Data/).
