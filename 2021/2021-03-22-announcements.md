## CFDE Trainings and Workshops
On March 18, the CFDE Training team hosted a second training session : Intro to Conda.  Attendees learned how to set up conda environments and manage software installations and discuss other applications, such as packaging software, running workflows, or creating binders. More workshops and trainings are being planned and will appear on our [events calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/) where anyone can click on a training event for registration details. Spread the word! 

We are committed to developing training workshops that will equip the CFDE with resources to enhance their research and collaboration efforts! Our Common Fund Training & Outreach Team would like your input on what lessons we can design to best achieve these goals in collaboration with your teams and users.
