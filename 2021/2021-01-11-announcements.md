## Events - "Ontologies 101" and Visible Human MOOC

Check out the newly released video, produced by HuBMAP associate member Mark Musen, that provides an introduction to ontologies - what they are, how they're used and why they're important in BioMed applications. Link to the video is [here](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001AO3bgqwNcEtselAHo0hC9UfP_HC8w1KH5_Zf8EuGct8TOebYtHjoFkfz3OOtCiqu2_qlsLglXLw-YQFuVqf_AVaAzGHtdN8SfGQQyCl3Pu0mmegJtCI95AR8-OW-QCnnkBfR3_BweDsGEZE-mumk7w==&c=oXkL0s8dI7qVlf_LiNn07tRwoZphVX2f_k1WhkejFMt8Al6fcFjUIA==&ch=fHMx_Ssp8aiU0qEpxBie_kj-3WevCJtIFc6lXVfopq4EZ9VFzJQEBw==).
