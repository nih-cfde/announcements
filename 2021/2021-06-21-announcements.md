## CFDE Trainings and Workshops

On **June 21st and 23rd** we are hosting a two part (2 hours each session) workshop series that provides hands-on experience in conducting basic RNA-Seq analysis in the cloud.  This workshop has been fully booked! Send inquiries to training@cfde.atlassian.net if you would like to know more.

On **June 30th at 10am PDT / 12pm EDT**, our popular 2-hour workshop: **Intro to AWS** introduces you to creating a computer “in the cloud” and logging into it, via Amazon Web Services. We create a small general-purpose Linux computer, connect to it, and run a small job, while discussing the concepts and technologies involved.

## Post-Doc Opportunity
The Fair Data Informatics (FDI) Laboratory is looking for a knowledge engineering Post-Doc (apply@fdilab.org) at the University of California, San Diego with a background in Computer Science, Informatics or a related field. This Post-Doc will be responsible for knowledge engineering and supporting systems involved in the querying, viewing, federating, analyzing, and managing of bio-medical ontologies and the use of these ontologies in the annotation of primary research data and the representation of knowledge extracted from this data related to NIH Common Fund projects.
