## SPARC FAIR Codeathon
The @NIHCommonFund's Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program has exciting news! The SPARC Data and Resource Center is hosting an in-the-cloud codeathon to make SPARC data, tools, and resources more FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable! Several prizes of up to US$10,000 each will be awarded. Submissions for project proposals are being accepted up until **Monday, May 10**: https://bit.ly/3mI81JZ
