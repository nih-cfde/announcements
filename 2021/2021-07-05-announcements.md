## DCC Meeting Updates
We have updated and changed many Bi-Weekly DCC meetings. All agendas and invitations have been updated, and some have been canceled in the reorganization. If you are a member attending these meetings for your DCC please be sure to check your mail: in some cases old meetings have been canceled with new invitations sent for the same time slots. _Scheduled meeting times have not changed, but invitations may have_. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our CFDE Help Desk: support@cfde.atlassian.net.
