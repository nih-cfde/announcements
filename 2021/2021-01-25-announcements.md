# CFDE Announcements

Greetings CFDE Members! To finish an eventful January we share Cross-Pollination and Training updates and report on the kick-off meetings for both our CFDE Anatomy Working Group (cAWG) and our new CFDE Ontology Working Group. 


## Events

## Anatomy Working Group Update

At the first CFDE Anatomy Working Group (cAWG) meeting GTEx and LINCS explained what their datatypes are and how they describe them. They are working towards a shared understanding of what types of anatomy the CFDE needs to support as well as at what level. GTEx has data at both gross and micro anatomy levels, and has biosamples, images, and bioinformatic data like RNAseq. LINCS has data and metadata terms and standards for cell lines, as well as tools to help query and visualize anatomical locations from which these cell lines were derived. LINCS plans to provide answers to questions about the granularity of search queries and others in following cAWG meetings.

You can check out the [cAWG Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K5L9WllqaABbr4MGO21ogDELyvtpVrD31wbvSNhx6ys/edit?usp=sharing) for meeting notes and information on communicating with or [joining the group](https://crosspollinationevents.groups.io/g/AnatomyWorkingGroup).
