# CFDE Announcements

## Cross-Pollination Events
The next event will be on **Tuesday, June 1, at 11am PDT / 2pm EDT**. Presentations from the [CFDE-CC and SPARC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CFpYz4lPG7Bktf_4ajSMME3ERNNO_VNHYPJOqcElNc0/edit?usp=sharing) will detail the CurIndex and the Connectivity Knowledge Base. Regular Cross-Pollination events take place on the first Tuesday of every month. Please check out the [Cross-Pollination Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQAeOLkivUZZnwZ_KxfGw3neezMaWbrPk9nnFiKfQGA/edit?usp=sharing) and let us know if you would like to present! We are actively looking for speakers for our July and August meetings. Please contact us today if you are interested in presenting at support@cfde.atlassian.net.

## CFDE Trainings and Workshops
Are you interested in Common Fund data? Come see a 1-hour pop-up demo on **Wednesday, May 26, at 10am PDT/ 1pm EDT** of the newly released CFDE Data Portal that allows you to search across data from HuBMAP, Kids First Data Resource Center, Metabolomics, LINCS, exRNA, GTEx, and HMP from a single website! [Register here](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/cfde-training-workshop/?pk_campaign=anc). 

Our series of R and RNA-Seq tutorials kicks off on **June 2** with our **[Intro to R Programming](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/intro-to-r/?pk_campaign=anc)** offering. This free two hour workshop will provide an overview of the basics of R programming language along with RStudio which is a user-friendly environment for working with R. You will be introduced to the syntax, variables, functions, packages along with the various data structures in R. You will also learn basics of data wrangling from reading data from files, subsetting, merging and exporting data out of the R environment.

On **June 9** we will hold a free two hour workshop featuring an overview of RNA sequence analysis with a focus on differential expression. In **[RNA-Seq Concepts, Designs, and Workflows](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/rnaseq-concepts-design-and-workflows-2/?pk_campaign=anc)** discuss experimental design and sample preparation and explore analysis workflows. By the end of this workshop you will know the fundamentals of designing a differential expression experiment, have a conceptual understanding of the process of RNAseq analysis, and understand common RNA-Seq problems and how to prevent them. 

Please check out the [CFDE Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/?pk_campaign=anc) to find and register for these and other future events. Our workshops are open to all, so feel free to share this information with interested friends and colleagues.

## Bridge2AI Opportunity
We are excited to announce that the NIH has issued a Research Opportunity Announcement (ROA) for Data Generation Projects for the Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Program (OT2). This ROA is soliciting Data Generation Projects to create flagship datasets based on ethical principles, associated standards and tools, and skills and workforce development to address biomedical and behavioral research grand challenges that require artificial intelligence and machine-learning (AI/ML) analysis. The Bridge2AI program plans to support the formation of teams richly diverse in perspectives, backgrounds, and academic and technical disciplines. This ROA requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP)--a summary of strategies to advance the scientific and technical merit of the proposed project(s) through inclusivity. Visit the [Bridge2AI Program Resources page](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai/programresources),
[Building Diverse Teams page](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai/enhancingdiverseperspectives), and [Program FAQs](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai/faqs) for additional information on building diverse teams and for PEDP guidance. 

Please refer to the research opportunity announcement for additional information on application submission and review ([OTA-21-008](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/OT2-Data-Generation-Projects-B2AI-051321-508.pdf)). Inquiries can be sent to the Bridge2AI program team at bridge2AI@od.nih.gov. A Letter of Intent (LOI) is required, LOIs must be emailed to bridge2ai@od.nih.gov by 11:59 PM ET on or before July 20, 2021.
