## CFDE Trainings and Workshops
The CFDE Training Team in collaboration with the [UC Davis DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/eventscalendar/introduction-to-remote-computing-11-part-series-workshop-1-intro-to-shell/) is hosting an 11-part workshop series in August. The course will introduce attendees to the principles and practice of remote computing with UNIX on workstations, HPCs, and cloud. Topics include shell, editing remote files, ssh, remote file transfer, software installation with conda, project organization, automating analyses, cluster compute with slurm, and cloud compute with AWS. This pilot workshop series is already completely booked, but you can still explore the [CFDE Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/?pk_campaign=anc) to find and register for other future events. Our workshops are open to all, so feel free to share this information with interested friends and colleagues. Questions? Contact us at training@cfde.atlassian.net
