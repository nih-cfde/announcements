## Introducing the CFDE Gene Working Group
The CFDE is starting up a Gene Working Group headed by Avi Ma'ayan and Shankar Subramaniam. They are looking for participants from every DCC, preferably with some coding background as they would like to design and implement some prototypes as part of WG activities. If you are interested, please join the mailing list so that we can organize meeting times. You can check out the [draft charter ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DbdbQ73_YlvG9iDuDSljyWyZWKdQDKNX/view?usp=sharing)for more details about the goals and activities proposed for the group. The group has a [mailing list ](https://crosspollinationevents.groups.io/g/GeneWorkingGroup) for interested members to join which we will use to organize meetings and activities. Members are being polled now to arrange the first meeting for this WG.
