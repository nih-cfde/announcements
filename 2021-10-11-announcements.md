## CFDE Trainings and Workshops
On October 13,  our team plans to host our **Intro to R Programming** lesson.  Registration is now full for this event. You can explore the [CFDE Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/?pk_campaign=anc) to find and register for future events. Our workshops are open to all, so feel free to share this information with interested friends and colleagues. 

## RFCs Available for Review and Comment - Final Notice
Two RFCs are now available for comment by the community until October 15, 2021:
- [Use of the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) for population of the “assay” field in C2M2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fTA2O71QkQD_yPmvGr0uz7Vr8FMTzvY3FyW66Y3qQYo/edit)
- [Alignment with PubChem for chemicals in C2M2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JV_xMWEV5bl3wWw3s1feomZKr2wlARFEaHw1tLYI7DY/edit)

RFC stands for “Requests for Comments”. **These are proposals being made by members of the CFDE to suggest that the CFDE community as a whole adopt the suggested new best practice**. Everyone in the community is invited to respond to these proposals by leaving comments, critiques, and support at the links above. Comments are open for one month at which point the documents will be reviewed. If there are no substantial objections to the RFC in that time, it will be adopted as a CFDE Best Practice. You can read more about our RFC process [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1masYhU6W_zgUWN1XWS8_f-KiSp1cTDdo4eZJWpsXyHQ/edit).

## NIH RFI Opportunity

Search Capabilities across the Biomedical Landscape for NIH-wide Data Discovery, NOT-OD-21-187: this RFI seeks input on use cases, expectations, and capabilities for enabling data and information discovery (search) to enhance NIH-wide data discovery and its reuse. In particular, NIH would like to understand better researchers’ experiences and expectations in finding data and information that would greatly enable their research capabilities and uncover underlying barriers or opportunities that can move the search landscape forward. All comments must be submitted to https://datascience.nih.gov/search-capabilities-across-the-biomedical-landscape by December 3rd.

## Working Group Updates

### Gene Expression Data Exchange Working Group 
This new group will survey and evaluate existing resources and then recommend standards for metadata, file formats, and an API for the CFDE to facilitate storing, retrieving, and querying gene expression data. For more detail see the [WG charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_Kjn_yBIYibco33zsmfBMrC0C39IGwW_VPu9b_iXnM/edit). We plan a kickoff meeting later in September.
