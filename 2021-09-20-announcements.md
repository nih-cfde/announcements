# CFDE Announcements

This week we have announcements for two new working groups we are starting up. Please scroll down to find out more about the **Gene Expression Data Exchange** and **Prototyping and Evaluation of Engineering Technology** Working Groups.

## Cross-Pollination Events
Our next scheduled meeting will take place on **Tuesday, October 5th at 11am PDT / 2pm EDT**. Representatives from Ex-RNA, HuBMAP, and GTEx will be presenting. Please contact us today if you are interested in presenting at an upcoming event at support@cfde.atlassian.net! Regular Cross-Pollination events take place on the first Tuesday of every month. Please check out the  [Cross-Pollination Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQAeOLkivUZZnwZ_KxfGw3neezMaWbrPk9nnFiKfQGA/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

## CFDE Trainings and Workshops
This Wednesday our training team will present our **[RNA-Seq Concepts, Designs & Workflows](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/rna-seq-concepts-designs-workflows/?pk_campaign=anc)** workshop. Click on the link to see more details and register! You can also explore the [CFDE Events Calendar](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/?pk_campaign=anc) to find and register for other future events including the follow up [RNA-Seq in the Cloud](https://www.nih-cfde.org/events/rna-seq-in-the-cloud-part-i/?pk_campaign=anc) sessions. Our workshops are open to all, so feel free to share this information with interested friends and colleagues. This month we have three sessions on RNA-Seq last presented in June. 

## RFCs Available for Review and Comment
Two new RFCs are now available for comment by the community until October 15, 2021:
- [Use of the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) for population of the “assay” field in C2M2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fTA2O71QkQD_yPmvGr0uz7Vr8FMTzvY3FyW66Y3qQYo/edit)
- [Alignment with PubChem for chemicals in C2M2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JV_xMWEV5bl3wWw3s1feomZKr2wlARFEaHw1tLYI7DY/edit)

RFC stands for “Requests for Comments”. These are proposals being made by members of the CFDE to suggest that the CFDE community as a whole adopt the suggested new best practice. Everyone in the community is invited to respond to these proposals by leaving comments, critiques, and support at the links above. Comments are open for one month at which point the documents will be reviewed. If there are no substantial objections to the RFC in that time, it will be adopted as a CFDE Best Practice. You can read more about our RFC process [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1masYhU6W_zgUWN1XWS8_f-KiSp1cTDdo4eZJWpsXyHQ/edit).

## Working Group Updates

### Gene Expression Data Exchange Working Group 
This new group will survey and evaluate existing resources and then recommend standards for metadata, file formats, and an API for the CFDE to facilitate storing, retrieving, and querying gene expression data. For more detail see the [WG charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_Kjn_yBIYibco33zsmfBMrC0C39IGwW_VPu9b_iXnM/edit). We plan a kickoff meeting later in September. To register your interest, please contact Bob Carter (GH: @RLC-DCPPC ; Slack: (at)Bob Carter; e-mail: rlc.dcppc@gmail.com) or Anup Mahurkar (GH: @amahurkar; Slack: (at)Anup Mahurkar).

### Ontology Working Group
The next meeting for the Ontology Working Group is scheduled for **Wednesday, September 22 at 8am PDT / 11am EDT**. Ontology Working Group meetings are scheduled bi-weekly on Wednesdays. RFC and Survey 'homework' tasks can be found in the [rolling agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VoHHBeWfol6XNJa3kzOnOFuTaIrcLYbqKYQcOnj1oh4/edit#heading=h.3ia46913z0oa). You can get involved by joining their [mailing list](https://cfdepublic.groups.io/g/OntologyWorkingGroup) and [slack channel](https://cfdeworkspace.slack.com/archives/C01GP14DLJX.).  

### PEET Working Group
The Prototyping and Evaluation of Engineering Technology (PEET) Working Group will be focused on finding and evaluating existing software engineering solutions to meet CFDE-CC and DCC needs. This working group will evaluate and choose existing software implementations, and/or prototyping modifications to implementations, that support ecosystem functionality such as data retrieval and resource registries. Our kick-off meeting will be on **Oct 1 at 8am PDT/ 11am EDT**.  The first meeting topic is "All about Appyters" and we will have a technical presentation and discussion about the underpinnings of the Appyter system.
